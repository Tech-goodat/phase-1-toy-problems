The function takes a single argument, `speed`, representing the car's current speed. It then compares this speed to a predefined speed limit of 70 units (e.g., miles per hour).

- If the car's speed is less than the speed limit, it logs "Ok" to indicate that the speed is within the limit.
- If the car's speed exceeds the speed limit, it calculates demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the limit. It uses a demerit point calculation of one point for every 5 units above the limit. If the calculated demerit points exceed 12, it logs "License suspended" to indicate that the driver's license is suspended.

## Usage

To use the `getCarSpeed` function in your JavaScript code, follow these steps:

1. Include the function in your codebase.

2. Call the function, passing the car's speed as an argument.
